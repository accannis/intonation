CHECKPOINT 4

Current Task: Optimizing Vocal Separation System
We are implementing caching for both lyrics and vocal separation to improve performance.

Progress:
1. Implemented lyrics caching:
   - Stores lyrics in cache/lyrics directory
   - Uses MD5 hash of audio file as key
   - Successfully loads cached lyrics on subsequent runs

2. Implementing vocal separation caching:
   - Stores separated vocals in cache/vocals directory
   - Uses MD5 hash of audio file as key
   - Just simplified code to save directly to cache location
   - Currently testing if caching works properly

Next Steps:
1. Test if vocal separation caching works after restart
2. Clean up any temporary directories
3. Consider adding cache cleanup/management features

File Changes:
1. Updated src/lyric_matching/lyric_provider.py with caching
2. Updated src/preprocessing/vocal_separator.py with direct cache saving
3. Modified src/main.py to work with cached lyrics

Current State:
- Lyrics caching is working properly
- Vocal separation caching implementation is complete but needs testing
- Program was running when we paused
